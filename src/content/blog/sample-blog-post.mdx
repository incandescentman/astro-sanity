# Introduction

This is an example blog post written in Emacs org-mode that will be automatically converted to MDX format for your Astro blog. Org-mode provides a powerful and flexible writing environment with excellent support for code blocks, tables, and structured content.


# Why Org-Mode for Blogging?

Org-mode offers several advantages for blog writing:

-   **Structured editing** with folding and navigation
-   **Rich formatting** including tables, lists, and emphasis
-   **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
-   **Export flexibility** to multiple formats
-   **Emacs integration** with all your favorite editing features


# Writing Code Examples

You can include code blocks easily in org-mode:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greetBlogger(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}! Welcome to org-mode blogging.`);
}

greetBlogger("Developer");
```

```python
# Python example
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```


# Block quotes

> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it. &ldquo;And what is the use of a book,&rdquo; thought Alice, &ldquo;without pictures or conversations?&rdquo;
> 
> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.


# Tables and Lists

Org-mode excels at creating structured content:


## Advantages of this workflow:

1.  **Write in Emacs.** Use all your favorite editing features
2.  **Structured content.** Org-mode&rsquo;s powerful organization
3.  **Easy export.** One command to convert to MDX
4.  **Version control.** Keep your .org files in git
5.  **Automation.** Script the publishing process


## Bullet lists

-   When the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it
-   And then hurried on, Alice started to her feet
-   For it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it


# Publishing Workflow

The workflow is simple:

1.  Write your post in `.org` format
2.  Use `M-x org-publish-to-astro-blog` to export and copy to your blog
3.  Commit and deploy your Astro site


# Advanced Features

# Conclusion

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
